        # This file consists of lines of the form:
        #
        #   name = value
        #
        # (The "=" is optional.)  Whitespace may be used.  Comments are introduced with
        # "#" anywhere on a line.  The complete list of parameter names and allowed
        # values can be found in the PostgreSQL documentation.
        #
        # The commented-out settings shown in this file represent the default values.
        # Re-commenting a setting is NOT sufficient to revert it to the default value;
        # you need to reload the server.
        #
        # This file is read on server startup and when the server receives a SIGHUP
        # signal.  If you edit the file on a running system, you have to SIGHUP the
        # server for the changes to take effect, run "pg_ctl reload", or execute
        # "SELECT pg_reload_conf()".  Some parameters, which are marked below,
        # require a server shutdown and restart to take effect.
        #
        # Any parameter can also be given as a command-line option to the server, e.g.,
        # "postgres -c log_connections=on".  Some parameters can be changed at run time
        # with the "SET" SQL command.
